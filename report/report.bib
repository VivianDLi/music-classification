  abstract = {In this paper, we present Waveprint, a novel method for audio identification. Waveprint uses a combination of computer-vision techniques and large-scale data-stream processing algorithms to create compact fingerprints of audio data that can be efficiently matched. The resulting system has excellent identification capabilities for small snippets of audio that have been degraded in a variety of manners, including competing noise, poor recording quality and cell-phone playback. We explicitly measure the tradeoffs between performance, memory usage, and computation through extensive experimentation. The system is more efficient in terms of memory usage and computation, while being more accurate when compared with previous state of the art systems. The applications of Waveprint include song identification for end-consumer use, copyright protection for audio assets, copyright protection for television assets and synchronization of off-line audio sources, such as live television.},

@article{Rein2006,
  abstract = {As the internet search evolves toward multimedia content based search and information retrieval, audio content identification and retrieval will likely become one of the key components of next generation internet search machines. In this paper we consider the specific problem of identifying the classical music composition of an unknown performance of the composition. We develop and evaluate a wavelet based methodology for this problem. Our methodology combines a novel music information (audio content) descriptor, the wavelet dispersion vector, with neural net assessment of the similarity between unknown query vectors and known (example set) vectors. We define the wavelet dispersion vector as the histogram of the rank orders obtained by the wavelet coefficients of a given wavelet scale among all the coefficients (of all scales at a given time instant). We demonstrate that the wavelet dispersion vector precisely characterizes the audio content of a performance of a classical music composition while achieving good generalization across different performances of the composition. We examine the identification performance of a combination of 39 different wavelets and three different types of neural nets. We find that our wavelet dispersion vector calculated with a biorthogonal wavelet in conjunction with a probabilistic radial basis neural net trained by only three independent example performances correctly identifies approximately 78% of the unknown performances.},
